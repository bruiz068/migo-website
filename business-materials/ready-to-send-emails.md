**Subject: Revolutionary Mobile Billboard Advertising Coming to Phoenix Metro**

Dear [Business Owner Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm the founder of Migo Advertisement, an innovative mobile billboard advertising company launching in the Phoenix Metro area.

**What We Do:**
We place high-resolution digital billboards on rideshare vehicles (Uber/Lyft), creating mobile advertising that follows your customers throughout their daily routes. Unlike static billboards, our ads move through high-traffic areas, business districts, and residential neighborhoods where your potential customers live and work.

**Why This Works for Your Business:**
- **Targeted Reach**: Your ads travel through specific neighborhoods and business districts
- **High Visibility**: Bright, eye-catching displays that stand out in traffic
- **Cost-Effective**: Fraction of the cost of traditional billboard advertising
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Track exactly where and when your ads are seen
- **Flexible Campaigns**: Change your message anytime through our digital platform

**Current Status:**
We're currently in our testing phase with 3 tablets and have secured city permits for metro-wide operations. Our official launch with 10 tablets is coming soon, and we're expanding to 50+ tablets across Arizona within the first year.

**Special Launch Offer:**
As one of our founding clients, you'll receive:
- 50% off your first month's advertising
- Premium placement guarantee
- Free ad design and optimization
- Detailed performance analytics

I'd love to schedule a brief 15-minute call to show you exactly how mobile billboard advertising can boost your business visibility and drive more customers to your door.

Are you available for a quick call this week?
