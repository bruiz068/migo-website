## THE HOOK (Create curiosity & excitement)

**"We're launching a revolutionary mobile billboard advertising platform on February 18th, and I'm personally reaching out to select businesses to offer founding partner access. Instead of static billboards, we put high-resolution digital displays on Uber and Lyft vehicles - so your ads follow customers wherever they go in Phoenix Metro."**

**"Here's what makes this special - your ads reach customers in business districts, residential neighborhoods, and high-traffic areas where traditional advertising just can't go. No ad blockers, no skipping, just direct exposure to potential customers during their daily routines."**

## THE OPPORTUNITY (Build value & urgency)

**"Now, we're only accepting 50 founding partners, and here's why this is huge:**
- **FREE advertising until our February launch** - that's 5+ months of no-cost impressions
- **$150 in FREE campaign credits** when we officially launch  
- **1-year price lock guarantee** - your rates never go up
- **Premium QR code tracking** normally $1-3 per scan, but free for you
- **Priority access** to the best time slots and routes"

**"I can even bring one of our tablets to your location for a FREE demo so you can see exactly how this works and what kind of coverage your area gets."**

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### **"I'm not interested in advertising right now"**
*"I totally understand, and that's actually why this timing is perfect. You're not paying anything until February - it's completely FREE advertising for the next 5+ months. Even if you're not actively advertising now, this gives you months to test it with zero risk."*

### **"How much does it cost?"**
*"That's exactly what I want to send you - the founding partner pricing is exclusive and not available publicly. It's significantly less than traditional billboard advertising, and remember, you get 5+ months completely free to test it out. What's your email so I can send the exact numbers?"*

### **"I need to think about it"**
*"Absolutely, that's smart business. That's why I want to send you all the details so you can review everything properly. The email includes case studies, pricing, and coverage maps for your area. What's the best email to send that to?"*

### **"We already do [other advertising]"**
*"That's great! This actually complements what you're already doing. Mobile billboards reach customers during their daily routines - like when they're heading to dinner, shopping, or running errands. It's the perfect addition to your current marketing. Let me send you the info so you can see how it fits with your existing strategy."*
