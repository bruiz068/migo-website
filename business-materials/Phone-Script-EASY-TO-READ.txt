PHONE SCRIPT - MigoAds Founding Partner Outreach
==================================================

OPENING 
-------

"Hi [Name], this is Bernardo with Migo Advertisement. How it going? Good! Listen, I've got something pretty cool happening in Phoenix that I think you'd want to know about. Got a second?"

THE PITCH
---------

"So I'm putting digital screens on Uber and Lyft headrests that display your ads right in front of passengers' eyes. Instead of hoping people drive by a billboard, your ads follow customers around town - to dinner, shopping, wherever they go - including visitors who fly into Phoenix."

"I'm launching January 15th, and all local businesses get free advertising until then. But I'm only giving 50 businesses the founding partner bonus - that's $150 in credits when we go live, plus a one-year price lock guarantee. It's like having a billboard that drives to your customers instead of waiting for them to drive to it."

THE ASK
-------

"I'd love to send you the details. There's no cost until January, and there's only a $200 kickoff fee to get everything configured. What's your email?"

[Get email address]

"Perfect! I'll send that over in the next hour. The email has a password-protected pricing page - password is 'migo2025' - so you can see exactly what this looks like."

CLOSING
-------

"Keep an eye out for that email, and if you want to see how this works, I can bring a demo right to your location. Sound good?"

OBJECTION HANDLING
==================

"Not interested in advertising"
-------------------------------
"I get it, but this is actually free until January. No cost to try it, and you get $150 in credits when we launch. Worst case, you get free advertising for a few months."

"How much does it cost?"
-----------------------
"That's what I want to send you! It's way cheaper than traditional billboards, and you get months free to test it. Just a $200 kickoff fee to get started. What's your email?"

"I need to think about it"
-------------------------
"Totally fair. Let me send you the info so you can look it over. What's your email?"

"We already advertise elsewhere"
-------------------------------
"Perfect! This just adds to what you're doing. Your ads literally follow customers around town instead of sitting in one spot. Let me send you the details."
